# Overview

This folder is for "library type" files that are most likely to be used across multiple projects.

Each file should be placed in a new directory with a README.md file explaining its use.

When you want to include a project, include the ``rules.mk`` for that project, and set ``$SHAREDLIBSROOT`` to the location of ``sharedlibs/``
